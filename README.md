To make sure that the programs that I wrote were maintainable, readable, and adaptable I made sure to follow common coding practices enabling modules to be easily adaptable for future projects. My approach to a problem as a computer scientist starts with figuring out the requirements and working out different possible solutions in order to find the best way to solve the problem. After that I create different test cases for the solution to ensure that it fulfills all of the requirements and identify any issues.
